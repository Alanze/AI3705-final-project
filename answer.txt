> Assistant: Based on the requirement document, I will extract the information into structured text using the defined module types: Object, Status, Module, and Action.

**Objects:**

1. Workpiece
2. Conveyor belt
3. Barrier arm
4. Sorting arm 1
5. Sorting arm 2
6. Chute 1
7. Chute 2
8. Chute 3

**Statuses:**

1. atFront (Workpiece is at the front of the conveyor belt)
2. stopped (Conveyor belt is stopped)
3. extended (Barrier arm is extended)
4. retracted (Barrier arm is retracted)
5. full (Chute is full)
6. notFull (Chute is not full)

**Modules:**

1. Color detection module
2. Electromagnetic sorting arms
3. Retroreflective photoelectric sensor

**Actions:**

1. Detect (Color detection module detects the material and color of the workpiece)
2. Stop (Conveyor belt stops)
3. Extend (Barrier arm extends)
4. Retract (Barrier arm retracts)
5. Sort (Sorting arm sorts the workpiece into a chute)
6. Start (Conveyor belt starts moving)
7. Store (Workpiece is stored in a chute)

**Structured Text:**

1. Workpiece Object, atFront Status, conveyorBelt Object
2. conveyorBelt Object, stopped Status
3. barrierArm Module, extended Status
4. sortingArm1 Module, retracted Status
5. sortingArm2 Module, retracted Status
6. chute1 Object, notFull Status
7. chute2 Object, notFull Status
8. chute3 Object, notFull Status
9. colorDetectionModule Module, Detect Action
10. electromagneticSortingArms Module, Sort
